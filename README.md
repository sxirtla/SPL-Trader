# SPL Trader - Splinterlands Market Trading Bot

A market trading bot that listens to HIVE blockchain transactions to automatically buys and sells cards based on your bids.

Code is based on https://github.com/derfabsSL/Splinterbuyer

## How it works

The bot streams the HIVE blockchain and listens for new sell orders. You can set bids for specific cards, rarities or editions, and when the bot finds a listing that fits one of your bids, it buys the card automatically.

### Features

-   Fully automated lightning-fast buying (and selling) of cards
-   Filter by card id, rarity, edition, gold foil
-   You can configure how many cards the bot should buy
-   You don't have to compete against other bidders like on Peakmonsters Autobid
-   Can run 24/7
-   Can be used to convert CREDITS to DEC

```
"posting_key": "your_posting_key"",
```

#### bids

1. `comment`: This field names your bids. You can write whatever you want here, the bot will ignore it.

```
"comment": "All cards"

2. `cards`: This specifies individual cards you want the bot to buy. For Example, to buy Chicken, you would put "131"
   If you fill in this field, all other ones will be ignored, you can leave them empty. See the example in config-example.json

Example, buy 5 1bcx chickens:

```
"cards": {
    "131": { "max_quantity": 5, "max_bcx": 1, "max_bcx_price": 1, "name": "chicken" }

   `alpha`
   `beta`
   `promo`
   `reward`
   `untamed`
   `dice`

   `common`
   `rare`
   `epic`
   `legendary`

Example, only buy epic and legendary cards:

```
"rarities": ["epic","legendary"]
```

   The keys are:
   `fire`
   `water`

   `monster`

Example, buy only summoners:

```
"types": ["summoner"]
```

7. `max_bcx`: To buy only cards with a bcx less than or equal to this value. Also if you buy a lower bcx card, this value will be reduced and you will buy a total of max_bcx cards. If you don't specify the value or set it to 0, the bot will buy only level 1 cards.

```
"max_bcx": 5
```

8. `max_bcx_price`: How much to pay for each bcx. If max_bcx is specified this value will be multiplied by the card bcx.

Example, if the card is 5 bcx this value will be 5 \* 0.5 = 2.5 USD and the bot will spend 2.5 USD for this card.

```
"max_bcx_price": 0.5
```

9. `min_cp_per_usd`: To buy only cards with a specific CP/USD (Collection Power per USD)

Example, buy cards with CP/USD >= 200:

```
"min_cp_per_usd": 200
```

10. `max_quantity`: How many cards the bot should buy for this specific bid. max_quantity can't be less than max_bcx

Example, buy 5 cards:

```
"max_quantity": 5
```

11. `gold_only`: If this is set to true, the bot will only buy gold foil cards.

Example, buy only gold foil cards:

```
"gold_only": true
```

12. `only_modern`: This parameter is meant to be paired with filtering for Reward and Promo Edition cards, because these cards cannot be filtered by edition, If this is set to true, the bot will NOT buy modern cards.

Example, buy only modern cards:

```
"only_modern": true
```

13. `sell_for_pct_more`: If you want the bot to put the cards on the market immediately after buying, you can use this parameter. The bot will sell the card for x percent more than the buy price. For example, if the card is bought for 10$ and "sell_for_pct_more" is set to 10, the bot will list the card for 11$
    **If you don't want the bot to sell automatically, leave this parameter at 0**

Example, sell for 10% higher than buy price:

```
"sell_for_pct_more": 10
```

Example 2, don't sell cards:

```
"sell_for_pct_more": 0
```

14. `auto_set_buy_price`: If this is set to true, the bot will check current market prices and bid accordingly, to buy underpriced cards.

```
"auto_set_buy_price": "true"
```

15. `buy_pct_below_market`: Use this parameter in combination with "auto_set_buy_price":true
    This specifies how many percent below the market price the bot should buy.
    **This is only active if "auto_set_buy_price":true**

Example, buy 10% below the current market price:

```
"buy_pct_below_market": 10
```

## Are my Keys Safe?

Your keys are only used to sign blockchain transactions for buying cards and will never leave your computer.
The bot needs your active key to be able to make purchases independently without needing confirmation for every purchase.
The code for this bot is open source, so you can see for yourself where the key is used and what for.
Also, I recommend using alt accounts, where you don't have many assets, for trading. You can use the Main account for rc delegation, using the accouns.rc_from option.
